        <td>
          A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent ROBOT for more than <strong>3 seconds</strong>.<br><br>
          A ROBOT is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either direct or transitive (such as against a FIELD element) and the opponent ROBOT is attempting to move.<br><br>
          A PIN count ends once any of the following criteria are met:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A.</strong> The ROBOTS have separated by at least 2 ft. (~61 cm) from each other for more than 3 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>B.</strong> Either ROBOT has moved 2 ft. from where the PIN initiated for more than 3 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>C.</strong> The PINNING ROBOT gets PINNED.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For criterion A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by 2 ft. until either the PIN ends or the PINNING ROBOT moves back within 2 ft., at which point the PIN count resumes.</p>
          <p>For criterion B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 2 ft. from where the PIN initiated until the PIN ends or until both ROBOTS move back within 2 ft., at which point the PIN count resumes.</p>
