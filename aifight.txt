Prompt to the AI:
Create an epic battle between my Computer Science professors Charles and Marc. Charles is a master of computational theory and often finds perplexing solutions to the most insane problems. Charles is armed with his devious mind and an extensive collection of tie-dyed shirts Marc, is best described as a metaphorical computing robot. Marc's mastery of low level machine architecture and detailed understanding of the inner workings of an operating system eaves him a force to be reckoned with. They encounter each other in the University Computer Science Offices, and are fated to fight to the death.

I, the omnipotent narrator of this tale, will control the world and the people in it, and will attempt to create the ultimate spectacle.
Charles is walking down the hall to his office, thinking about the paper he's going to write, or a joke he's going to tell, or maybe even about one of his classes.
He enters his office, and sees the window facing the hall. There is a reflection in the glass that resembles a human figure.
"Hey Marc."
The reflection waves.
Marc's office is at the end of the hall. He's sitting at his computer, and hears a knock on his door.
"Come in."
The door opens, and in walks a tall, slender, black man.
"Hey Charles."
"Hey Marc."
"Wazzup?"
"Nuthin."
"You need somethin?"
"Nope."
"Well, I gotta get back to work."
"Yeah, me too."
They leave the room, and head off in separate directions.
"So," Marc thinks to himself, "what are we gonna do?"
He reaches his office and sits down.
"This is gonna be hard."
"Oh yeah?" Charles thinks. "You don't think I can beat you?"
"I didn't say that."
"Good."
"What do you want to do?"
"I don't know."
"Well, that makes two of us."
They sit there in silence for a while, each of them contemplating their own thoughts.
Finally, Charles speaks.
"How about we go for a walk?"
"Okay."
"And maybe go for a swim?"
"Sounds good."
"And then maybe go to a movie."
"I like movies."
"Yeah, me too."
So they get up, and head out the door.
Marc is standing outside his office, and sees the door open, revealing Charles.
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Wazzup?"
"Nuthin much. You?"
"Same here."
"Well, see ya later."
"Yeah, see ya."
They head off in opposite directions, but stop at the same time.
"What was that all about?" Marc wonders.
"Beats me," Charles thinks.
"Well, I'd better get back to work."
"Yeah."
So they continue their separate ways.
Marc's at his desk, and Charles is sitting in his chair.
"So," Charles says, "how are things?"
"Pretty good."
"That's good."
"Yeah."
"Well, I'd better get back to work."
"Yeah, me too."
They leave the office and go their separate ways.
"That was weird," Marc thinks.
"I'm gonna go take a shower."
"Me too."
"Okay."
"Well, I'll see ya."
"Yeah, see ya."
"See ya."
"Bye."
They head off, and Marc is left standing there, wondering what just happened.
Charles is standing outside his office, and sees the door open.
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Wazzup?"
"Nuthin much. You?"
"Same here."
"Well, I'd better get back to work."
"Yeah, me too."
They continue their separate ways.
"So," Charles thinks, "what am I gonna do?"
"I don't know."
